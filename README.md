## Problem Statement

I identified a common challenge in the food service industry where customers are not aware of real-time product availability. This often leads to order modifications, longer waiting times, and customer dissatisfaction. To solve this, I developed a digital menu and billing system that provides live product availability, product images, and streamlined order management through an admin dashboard.

## Solution

FoodBill Pro is a digital menu and billing system that allows customers to view all menu items in real time — including product images, descriptions, prices, and live availability status. This eliminates the back-and-forth between customers and staff, reduces decision time, and improves the overall ordering experience.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Images stored as Base64 in MySQL** — no file system dependency, works on any deployment
- **JWT in localStorage** — simple implementation for development; production should use httpOnly cookies
- **WhatsApp via wa.me** — zero cost bill delivery without any third-party API
- **Redux Toolkit** — centralized state for cart, products and auth across all pages
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — CSS-based config, no tailwind.config.js required

---

## Containerization

- Backend (Spring Boot) is containerized with a **Dockerfile**, with a **.dockerignore** to keep the build context clean (excludes `target/`, `.mvn/`, IDE/config files, etc.)
- Frontend containerization is planned next — will follow a multi-stage build (Vite build stage → lightweight static server) to keep the image small
- A `docker-compose.yml` tying frontend, backend, and MySQL together is a planned next step once both images are ready
